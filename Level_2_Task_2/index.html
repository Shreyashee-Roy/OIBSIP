      <p>Sreedhara Panicker Somanath (born July 1963), better known as S. Somanath, is an Indian aerospace engineer serving as the chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Under his chairmanship, ISRO carried out the third Indian lunar exploration mission named Chandrayaan-3. The lander named Vikram and the rover named Pragyan landed near the lunar south pole region on 23 August 2023 at 18:04 IST, making India the first country to successfully land a spacecraft near the lunar south pole and the fourth country to demonstrate soft landing on the Moon.

      Somanath served as the director of Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, Thiruvananthapuram and director of Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre, Thiruvananthapuram. Somanath is known for his contributions to launch vehicle design, particularly in the areas of launch vehicle systems engineering, structural design, structural dynamics, and pyrotechnics.</p>

      <p>India and the world await a historic landing on the southern pole of the Moon as the countdown for the same by Chandrayaan-3 mission begins. The spacecraft has completed all orbit and deboosting maneuvers. It's now aiming to find the perfect spot for a soft landing on the Moon's challenging terrain. The Lander Module, consisting of the Vikram lander and Pragyan rover, separated from the Propulsion Module last Thursday. The module also captured and sent back images of the Moon's surface on Monday. These images, taken by a camera developed by the Space Application Centre (SAC) under the guidance of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), will help locate a safe landing area on the Moon without boulders or deep trenches. 
      S Somanath, who took charge of the Indian space agency in January last year is considered one of the key persons behind India’s ambitious moon mission. Somanath served as the director of Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) and the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre — the primary centres for development of rocket technologies for ISRO. Along with the ongoing Chandrayaan-3, other major missions like Aditya-L1 to Sun and Gaganyaan (India's first manned mission) are under his supervision.
